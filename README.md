        <h1 id="title">Three-Eyed Raven</h1>
         <p>The Three-Eyed Raven was the last greenseer, a human living among the last of the Children of the Forest beyond the Wall. His real name is unknown. Under the guise of a three-eyed raven, he appears in Bran Stark's vision-dreams, following his fall and injury, prompting his quest beyond the Wall and guiding him to the cave in which his real human body resides. There, Bran is trained in the magic of Greensight.</p>

 <ul>
            <li>Season One appearances: After his fall from the tower and awakening from the subsequent coma, the raven appears to Bran Stark multiple times in his dreams. In them, it appears as Bran is about to fire an arrow and causes him to stop before he shoots. Then, the raven lands on the head of a direwolf statue, cries once and then flies deep into the Stark family crypt.</li>  
            <li>Season Two appearances: Bran asks Osha about the significance of the Three-Eyed Raven but she does not divulge anything.

                The Three-Eyed Raven watches Maester Luwin send ravens as Theon is attacking Winterfell.</li> 
            <li>Season There appearances: While traveling north, Bran dreams once again of the Three-Eyed Raven. In the dream he's able to walk and attempts to shoot at him with a bow and arrow. A strange boy then appears in the dream, and tells Bran that he cannot kill the raven, because Bran is the raven.</li> 
            <li>Season Four appearances: Bran and his group eventually reach the giant weirwood tree on the hill, but are attacked by a group of wights hiding beneath the ice.

            <li>Season Six appearances: The Three-Eyed Raven monitors Bran as he experiences a vision of Winterfell during the childhood of Lyanna and Ned Stark that reveals Hodor's true name, Wylis.
